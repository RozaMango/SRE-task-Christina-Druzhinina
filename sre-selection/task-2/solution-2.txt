I used Minikube with Docker Desktop.
So I installed Minikube and Docker Desktop on my PC from the official websites >> then enabled Kubernetes option in the Settings of Docker Desktop.

The issue is in the part: 
spec:
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
              - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/application
                operator: In
                values:
                - "sretest"

As when I removed that code, there was no issue and everything worked. I found this information: 
If you're trying to deploy this configuration on your local machine using Minikube or a similar local Kubernetes cluster, you typically don't need to specify node labels for node affinity. In such cases, you can remove the nodeSelector section altogether from the deployment.yaml file.
