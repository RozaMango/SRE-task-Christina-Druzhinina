As we can see that the biggest number of requests goes from one IP. So, it can be bots trying automatically brute force the backend or spam. It's always good to use a Firewall to prevent overload the system.

Also, there are no server errors like 500, so theer is no issue with the server.

Howover, it is noticible that there are many requests in first 4 minutes and then the last minute we got few requests. Again, if it spam or bot activities, the system will not react immediately to the changes in the Network. So, or the spam activity is stopped or the Firewall start to work after some alert was sent and on the 5th minute  we got fewer requests. 

The HTTP 499 error appears in Nginx logs. This can happen for several reasons, but most commonly, itâ€™s due to either a browser timing out or a user canceling the request.

Important to note that this can also be caused by the server; if the server takes too long to respond, the client gives up. In this case, it is necessary to check the Load Balancer or/and CDN setup. 

If to wait enough and do not close the connection (that shows 499 error), the user would see 504 error. As we can see, that the error appears only on one page and on the same website, so it make sense to  check Load Balance/CDN logs and see if the issue is with those services or the issue is on the client's side.
